This is task manager.

The aim of this application is to help user in planning their tasks.
The task has the following parameters:
  * id
  * title
  * description
  * status

The app has a possibility to add new task, update an existing one, delete, change task status, get the list of tasks and get task by id.
For creating this functionality I have used Java 17, Spring Boot, SQL(Postgresql), Docker, JDBC, Postman, Maven.
